# **Challenge:**

Upwork and Fiverr charge very high fees for freelancers, anywhere from 10-20%. This eats at freelancersâ€™ profit margins, as they also have to pay taxes and other expenses. 

# **Solution:**

BitLance is an open source platform for job posters and freelancers to conduct business and dodge the high fees of popular freelance platforms. Our platform boasts no centralized fee (possibly 1 or 2% to have slight monetization), other than the gas fees themselves. BitLance will leverage smart contracts to ensure that each job is done right and that the freelancer is paid. All payments will be made in cryptocurrency, mainly ethereum. 

# **Why it is important:**

BitLance is being built on the ethereum blockchain (using Mode network) to give job posters and freelancers a way to do business without paying egregious amounts in fees to big corporations. This will also provide ratings for each poster/freelancer, so youâ€™ll know if someone isnâ€™t trustworthy or not.
